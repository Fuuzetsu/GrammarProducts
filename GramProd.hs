-- | The @GramProd@ executable reads a grammatical description (from stdin or a
-- file) and produces a set of grammars, each written into a separate file.
--
-- It is possible to both, produce @LaTeX@ and @Haskell@ output. The Haskell
-- grammars require "ADPfusion" to be useful -- and you have to provide
-- algebras that actually evaluate parses.
